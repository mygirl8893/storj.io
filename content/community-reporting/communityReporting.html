Title : "Report Abuse"
subheading: If you see or have experienced any unacceptable behavior, please contact a community leader as soon as you can via direct message, or file a report through the below form.
---

<div style="text-align:left">
    <p>After you submit, a moderator will respond to your message informing you that it has been received. We will address the issue as promptly as possible, but be aware that not all resolutions are immediate. Our responses are usually decided after we have a short discussion among community leads. You will not be penalized or banned for reporting a harassment or discrimination problem. If the complaint involves a community lead, that lead must recuse themself from being in charge of reviewing the submission. </p>
    <div class="spacer10"></div>
    <p>The Storj and Tardigrade community is committed to fostering an environment that is free of harassment. We do not tolerate harassment in any form. This includes, but is not limited to, harassment based on: sex, gender, gender expression/identity, sexual orientation, age, color, language abilities, nationality, immigration/refugee status, physical or mental disability, socio-economic class, physical appearance, race, ethnicity, or religious creed (including religious dress and grooming practices).</p>
    <div class="spacer10"></div>
    <p>Please review our <a href="/code-of-conduct/">Code of Conduct</a>. The Code of Conduct and Reporting Process are both living documents, and may evolve over time. If you have suggestions for changes to either policy, please let us know.</p>
    <div class="spacer10"></div>
    <p>Contacting us through the form or by private message helps us apply the same consistent confidentiality practices for everybody. Please do not reach out to the Storj community leaders via other channels, such as their personal email addresses or social media accounts. If your report is not delivered through a private message within our community forum or the form below, we cannot guarantee that it will be seen and addressed.</p>

    <div class="spacer25"></div>
    <h3>Confidentiality</h3>
    <div class="spacer10"></div>
    <p>Any request for anonymity for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse will be respected. We may publicly name a person about whom weâ€™ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe these actions are for the betterment of the community and increase the safety of Storj or Tardigrade community members. We will not name harassment victims without their consent. </p>
    <div class="spacer10"></div>
    <h3>Consequences</h3>
    <div class="spacer10"></div>
    <p>If one of our community leaders or an admin contacts you to stop certain behavior, please do so immediately. Failure to do so may result in the moderator muting, deactivating, or banning you, at their discretion.</p>
    <p>If your behavior has drawn attention that requires a community leader to contact you, please be aware that this will be documented for other community leaders to review and reference. Repeating the behavior or continuing comments after being asked to stop will result in being muted.</p>
    <p>If you have been given a warning but respond by personally attacking other members of the community, calling out the community leader who reached out to you, or try to attack the person you think reported the incident, this will result in your account being deactivated.</p>
    <p>Deactivation is the last resort and as such is not up for appeal. Please, be kind to your fellow community members.</p>
