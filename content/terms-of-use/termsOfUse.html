<p><b>18.	&nbsp;&nbsp;	GOVERNING LAW; DISPUTE RESOLUTION.</b>.

<p><b>a.	&nbsp;&nbsp;	Governing Law</b>. This Agreement and any disputes arising under it will be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to its conflict of laws provisions and each party consents to the personal jurisdiction and venue of the state or federal courts located in Fulton County, Georgia. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.</p>

<p><b>b.	&nbsp;&nbsp;	Initial Dispute Resolution</b>. The parties agree that most disputes can be resolved without resort to litigation. If you have any dispute with us, you agree that before taking any formal action, you will contact us at <a href="mailto:legal@storj.io" class="link">legal@storj.io</a> and provide a brief, written description of the dispute and your contact information (including your username, if your dispute relates to an account). Except for intellectual property and small claims court claims, the parties agree to use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation with Storj, and good faith negotiations shall be a condition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration. </p>

<p><b>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;		MANDATORY ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER</b></p>

<p><b>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.</b></p>

<ol type="i">
		<li><p><b>Binding Arbitration</b>.  You and Storj agree that these Terms of Use affect interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration provisions. The parties agree to use their best efforts to settle any dispute directly through consultation with each other before initiating arbitration, as described herein.  All claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including its formation, performance and breach), the parties’ relationship with each other and/or your use of the Services shall be resolved solely and exclusively by final and binding arbitration initiated and conducted according to the JAMS/Endispute Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures in effect as of the date hereof before a single arbitrator. If the Parties cannot agree upon selection of an arbitrator, then JAMS shall appoint the arbitrator experienced in the enterprise software industry. The place of the arbitration will be Fulton County, Georgia. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may enforce judgment upon any arbitration award in any court of competent jurisdiction located in Georgia.  Additionally, the Parties may seek injunctive or other equitable relief to protect its Intellectual Property Rights, Confidential Information, or as otherwise required to prevent irreparable harm, in any court of competent jurisdiction selected by the Company. The prevailing party in any action or proceeding hereunder, including any arbitration or court proceedings, will be entitled to recover its reasonable costs and attorneys’ fees. The parties understand that, absent this mandatory arbitration provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.  
		</p></li>
		<li><p> Class Action Waiver. The parties further agree that the arbitration shall be conducted in the party’s respective individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. YOU AND STORJ AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provisions set forth above shall be deemed null and void in their entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.</p></li>
		<li><p>Exception: Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims. Notwithstanding the parties’ decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring enforcement actions, validity determinations or claims arising from or relating to theft, piracy or unauthorized use of intellectual property in state or federal court with jurisdiction or in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to protect its intellectual property rights (“intellectual property rights” means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights). Either party may also seek relief in small claims court in Fulton County, Georgia for disputes or claims within the scope of that court’s jurisdiction.</p></li>
		<li><p>Changes to This Section. Storj will provide thirty (30) days’ notice of any changes to this section by posting on the Services. Amendments will become effective thirty (30) days after they are posted on the Services or sent to you by email. Changes to this section will otherwise apply prospectively only to claims arising after the thirtieth (30th) day. If a court or arbitrator decides that this subsection on “Changes to This Section” is not enforceable or valid, then this subsection shall be severed from the section entitled Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver, and the court or arbitrator shall apply the first Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section in existence after you began using the Services.</p></li>
		<li><p>Survival. This Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section shall survive any termination of your use of the Services.</p></li>
