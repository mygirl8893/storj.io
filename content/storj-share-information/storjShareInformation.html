<p>Using the Storj Share software makes your computer part of a distributed network. This means your computer may communicate with many other computers. This works just like any other communication on the internet, like when you connect to Facebook or Google. As part of this process, those other nodes can store some information about your computer and your interactions.</p>

<p>None of this information is dangerous to share with the network. Your computer shares a lot of it every day when you browse the web. We firmly believe that you have the right to be aware of the information you're sharing, and be able to make decisions about your own privacy.</p>

<p>Here's a list of some things that other people can learn about your computer:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><b>IP Address</b> - This is your computer's address on the Internet. This needs to be shared so that other nodes' messages can reach your computer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>IP-associated information</b> - Using your IP address, it is often possible to look up an approximate location (usually what city you are likely in) as well as your ISP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Network information</b> - When you communicate with another node, it can record how long it takes your node to respond, and test your internet connection's bandwidth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Node ID</b> - This is a pseudonym for your computer. It's a long group of random numbers that can be used to identify a node on the network, like a phone number. You need to send this out so that other nodes can identify and contact your node.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Payment details</b> - Your computer will share a payment address, so that other nodes can pay it directly for storage space.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Disk space information</b> - In order to negotiate storage contracts, your computer has to let other nodes know some information about how much it can store.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are not comfortable sharing this information, we recommend that you do not run the Storj Share client, or take other measures to protect yourself. If you have any questions about your privacy on the network, please email us at <a href="mailto:hello@storj.io" class="link">hello@storj.io</a>.</p>
